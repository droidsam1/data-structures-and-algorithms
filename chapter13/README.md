## Chapter 13. Recursive algorithms for speed

The following exercises provide you withe opportunity to practice with fast sorting. The solutions
to these exercises are found in the section, Chapter 13, on page 451.

1. Given an array of positive numbers, write a function that returns the greatest product of any
   three numbers. The approach of using three nested loops would clock in at O(N<sup>3</sup>), which is very
   slow. Use sorting to implement the function in a way that it computes at O(N log N) speed. (There
   are even faster implementations, but we're focusing on using sorting as a technique to make code
   faster.)
