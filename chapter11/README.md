## Chapter 11. Learning to write Recursive

The following exercises provide you with the opportunity to practice with recursion. The solutions
of these exercises are found the section Chapter 11, on page 448

1. Use recursion to write a function that accepts and array of strings and returns the total number
   of characters across all the strings. For example, if the input array
   is ```["ab", "c", "def","ghij"]```, the output should be ``10`` since there are 10 characters in
   total
2. Use recursion to write a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array
   containing just the even numbers.
